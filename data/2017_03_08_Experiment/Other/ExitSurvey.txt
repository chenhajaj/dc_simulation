d4sMfmxSGr5dYXkzf	AK7LGB1QOGA1P	37	Female	Bachelor's degree	USA	Couple of times I just chose the color to see if others would follow, but more often than not, wuuld wait to see what other teammates did as I often had small teams.  	First time I waited until timer ran down then switched...hahahaha.  Then most of the time I would just hold my own despite their pleas.  One time I waited too long to switch so the "run down the clock" strategy was not a good one.	none

pd73cEGSGed4SSJnC	A1A8L6LU8E2YOA	27	Male	Associate degree	USA	I would choose whatever color showed up most on my screen then relay my information to others. I would then follow their advice	I would give false information such as "3 RED 1 GREEN" when the opposite was true 	
LkTWP86cbn6guEo7M	A27BPRHBM28XZS	29	Male	Associate degree	USA	seeing what the majority of players around me chose and choosing that color, then announcing the color	Just try to create confusion in the chat	
XkaCcfSdETv3B8FGW	A2581F7TDPAMBQ	36	Female	Bachelor's degree	USA	I tried to direct the other players as much as possible when playing team consensus.	I went with my best guess of the no-consensus for these rounds.	N/A
2A6KpCduTgkLTRuTG	A1OBB3PWYWK9KK	25	Female	Bachelor's degree	USA	I told the other players how many of each color I saw and changed my color to agree with the most others.	I changed my color to oppose the majority and lied about what I saw.	
jPptxcg4eNY4czh7W	A28ZPY6D5AS7GZ	44	Male	Attended college	USA	just tried to be what I could discern was the popular color	This was funner. Just be the one different color.

sTLvz8DuPTLP9dcWL	A1EAEZ7VIHKQ2	30	Female	Attended college	USA	I just tried to go with what the majority chose.	I just tried to stay opposite the majority.	
4KyXWz6ezeyTmNNYf	AWD97KUKGN0LR	39	Male	Attended college	USA	Tried to look at majority of neighbors and match.  Stated how many were X color on my board.	Tried to send mixed messages about colors on my board and then change message late in round to get people to swap.	None but this was fun.
tALKH3dKkoan5Pd2g	A1D36KAPWAUPTJ	24	Male	High school degree or lower	USA	telling how many i saw a certain color, to convince them what the majority was	I tried to be deceitful and lie about how many I saw each color.	
kb2zSKd3ieRQddg7x	A2W59CL4UQ3S4S	35	Female	Doctoral degree or higher	USA	I tried to choose a similar color to my neighbors and check to see what the other people had by posting messages	I tried to be different than neighbors but it didn't always work. Also I have a JD not a Doctorate.	At the beginning I earned .40 and then it reset to zero. My bonus total should be .40 higher than what I saw at the end. Thanks again!!
xZC8PTvzZsPdGNSgN	A2VN3OJKI3R6HE	54	Male	Attended college	USA	Go with majority	oppose majority	
7kNxxTHTBDMKDQt72	A1TL6GOSY0W1YC	31	Male	Associate degree	USA	I chose the color of the majority. I would call out what colors I saw around me.	I would go against the majority and change colors as the majority changed.	
Dgj89iAmZg3AQWauP	A1LB4EJUIYDMYJ	27	Male	Associate degree	USA	I would go for the majority, and only message if people were really split	I'd choose the opposite and frequently change.	A few times my bonus got reset to 0 early on. I think I played 15 or so rounds extra, I remember the bonus going from around 80 cents to 0, and then once again from about 1.40 to 0, before I had to redo the 65 rounds.
Na9JEqi2rtNAJneyd	A3RR85PK3AV9TU	29	Male	Attended college	USA	I tried to match all neighbors. Sometimes tried switching at the end to defeat no-consensus, but not many would ever switch.	I tried to make sure there wasn't a consensus, keep my color different from neighbors, and sometimes send a false message about the number disagreeing with the aligned neighbors.	
SFw4XxELi7GmNTjd2	A150GMV1YQWWB3	37	Male	High school degree or lower	USA	I tried to tell others how many red vs green I saw, and went with the majority. 	I tried to do the opposite of what was going on in chat to confuse.

QkRaRdHjdXJRtpzr3	A1XDMS0KFSF5JW	37	Male	Associate degree	USA	i tried to yell out the color i wanted at the very  beginning in hopes to presaude everyone.  Then at the end i suddenly changed colors in hopes i was the last hold out	I tried to make myself look untrustworthy then say what everyone else really had in hopes to get them too change. 	
yzHgeqM44FuWpErxD	A2ERLVVT1F5UC3	21	Female	High school degree or lower	USA	I just tried to keep the same color as the neighbors I could see, if it was ticking down I tried to change color to see if that made a difference	I just kept the opposite color as most others and ignored the chat to change colors.	Thanks.

I mostly just misrepresented what I was seeing to make it look like there was less of a consensus than there was .

n5tcYmK6c8Peg6M37	A1JV64BL3WCK0G	38	Female	High school degree or lower	USA	I let others know what the majority was. I called out people to change.	I flipped colors to confuse people. I called out the wrong ratios to confuse people.

AbSQSxn8Fd7HQAscn	A3LC6M2EMDBBXP	27	Female	Attended college	USA	just tried to go with everyone else		Were the bonuses and communication supposed to be the same every round? Because I remember in the instructions about bonuses being varied, and sometimes not being able to communicate, things like that, but nothing ever changed for me.  
iQ89BhPYE4frMFA2E	A3MUTEQC6CC7UJ	26	Female	Attended college	USA	I reported which color was majority for me and also how many of each color I was connected to.  If I was only connected to one or two people I waited to pick a color so I didn't throw off the consensus.	I did the opposite of when I was consensus.  I would falsely report colors I was connected to to cast doubt as to which color was actually in majority.
