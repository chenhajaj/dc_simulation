Polling was done on unused workers from the previous session (03.08.2017), some of which have been recruited in earlier sessions (all in March 2017).

Worker A2HNL20X0Q9BP0 tried to complete the poll, even though they were not invited and have already participated in an adversarial experiment session. They were removed from the list of respondents.
