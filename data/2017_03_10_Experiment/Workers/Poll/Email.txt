IMPORTANT:
1. Please enter your MTurk worker ID in the 'Name' field (NOT your actual name).
2. All times are given in CT (US Central Time).
3. In case there is a change in your availability after you submit your initial poll response, please email us as soon as possible, so that we can choose a time slot for which enough people are available, or postpone the session if needed.
4. Please give your response by 6:00 PM CT today, Thursday, March 9. We will inform you of the selected experiment start time no later than 10:00 PM CT.

The experiment will consist of a sequence of 5 practice 60-second games for which you will not receive any additional reward, followed by a sequence of 68 60-second regular games. Games will be organized in batches of size 1 (68 batches of regular games in total). For each of the regular games, you will receive a base payment of $0.15 (this per-game base payment is already calculated into the HIT reward of $10.20, and is not an additional bonus payment). On top of the base payment, for each game, depending on the particular game incentives and your performance you can earn a bonus payment of up to $0.40. (Note that in some games the maximum bonus payment you can earn could be as low as $0.20.) The estimated task completion time is 1 hour and 20 minutes.
