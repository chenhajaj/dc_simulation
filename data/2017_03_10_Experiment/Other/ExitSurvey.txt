Wihh2ssfg3woTna87	A4JU6ZFL8C1VG	36	Female	Master's degree	USA	Tried to match players that were known consensus team members.	Tried to watch those who had orange circles, switch when it appeared a consensus was close.	This was interesting and fun. Thank you!

qXcT2ig5agB3b55Sn	A12U7YNO0GKNKZ	33	Male	Bachelor's degree	USA	I just tried my best to follow the trend of what was chosen amongst others.	I waited until the close to close and would change my answers.

pnYPqNFgqQamopDNx	A3MYPYBVHX7FQ2	46	Male	Attended college	USA	I tried to watch what the other players were doing, to figure out which node was a non-consensus node. The best I could do was to try to get the other consensus nodes to move quickly enough to form consensus before the non-consensus node could react.	I watched all other nodes carefully and switched colors as quickly as it looked like a consensus might be reached.	
9y7yuYtXwc3xp2v78	A24GPHD08ZS5LT	29	Female	Bachelor's degree	USA	I would either pick my color before everyone else and let them follow, or follow everyone else. 	I choose first, but kept my mouse on the opposite color if someone chose to pick the same color. 	This experiment was a little confusing, but I did my best. Very interesting too.
rzAsGaqxFwgdCzWar	A1LRDHZZUVF9AZ	33	Male	Master's degree	PRT	Tried to choose the color that my neighbors had and communicate with them when the chat was available.	Always kept changing my color so it didn't match my neighbors. 	Great HIT and THANK YOU for allowing non-us on your HIT's. We do speak English fluently and it's a shame we can't work on most of the hit's because requester?s think we're less capable.
xfq9ADffE8MTHvmTd	AEI5USUUPBU2G	31	Female	Bachelor's degree	USA	I tried to match the majority of my neighbors. I sent out messages to indicate my color choice to my neighbors.	During at least one time on no-consensus I made no attempt to interrupt the consensus team because payouts would be higher for everyone if we reached consensus every time. However, despite playing like a consensus member, the group still did not reach a consensus, so after that I decided to just play for myself. When I was no-consensus I attempted to disturb the other players.	fun and interesting game! thanks for the opportunity to play!
YPEYLn5g28h9Fyj5Q	A17R9PYLUB516A	26	Female	Associate degree	USA	I tried to choose what the majority had and say to all switch that way.	I tried to pick and say opposite of what the majority was.	N/A
7anj9XGFdkeGPmbHM	A8RDXT4ZILHQT	20	Female	Attended college	USA	I tried to tell everyone to tell their friends to go to the right color, and I remained steadfast in this. I basically always decided on something and stuck to it.	I could literally do nothing an win but one idea that always worked. Essentially, I'd immediately set a color and, then, come back 30 seconds later to set another color. Most people set their colors immediately and don't come back. So, they take the first color. But, half the people come back and look at the new colors. So they set to the other color.	
ddo6ubteJEZKRktFD	A1ZRH6U4OYYM1S	29	Male	Master's degree	IND	If message was allowed, first i look for the orange neighbor, if not , i will consider the color of neighbors and change accordingly.	I will message the opposit color of all neighbors (if messaging possible) otherwise i change color to look if some one is changing according to me. If yes, i try to stay in the opposite color of my neighbours	Nothing
6LEnbkwZAA2ccj7iK	A27BRY2BI6NNPW	35	Female	Associate degree	USA	It was hard.  All my team mates colors were the same but their teammates weren't so it was hard to get consensus.  I tried to follow the people that were shaded in orange. But if most of my teammates were a different color I would switch.	I tried to get them to change colors.  At first it was not hard.  Then after people got use to the game you could tell who were the deceptive people were.	That was a fun game even though it was very hard to get everyone's consensus.

2mLdhcXpytqorjdtN	A3GEL5PWFIK05S	28	Female	Attended college	USA	Any time I could send messages was easier.  I would ask for proof if someone was claiming a color, if they had an orange player, I followed them.  If there was no chat, I would try to match the majority of my node, and if someone kept changing from the color to the opposite, I would assume they were attempting to tell me they were being forced, so I would switch to them, hoping others would follow.  I also tried to convince people when we had a text box that it was smarter to forgo the bonus in no-consensus in exchange for getting more consensuses, therefore making more money, but no one seemed to get that.	I wanted to sacrifice my bonus in order to get other's to a non-consensus but they weren't going to do that, so very quickly I said "screw it" and played only for myself.  My bonus wasn't as high as I had hoped it would get to, so I stopped caring about the other players, since no one else was playing nice.	This took longer than the estimated time by about 10 minutes.  It was very frustrating.  I'm upset with the minimal bonus I got.  I spent around 80 minutes for $15 - that's still below minimum wage.
